# Low-level Programming & Algorithm

Welcome to the Low-level Programming & Algorithm repository! This repository focuses on foundational programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and system programming in the Linux and Unix environments.

## Hatching out

The Hatching out section explores introductory topics in low-level programming. Projects here cover basic concepts, such as memory management, pointers, bitwise operations, and introductory algorithms implemented in C or similar languages.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

In the Data Structures and Algorithms section, you will find projects and implementations of various data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithms (searching, sorting, dynamic programming, graph algorithms). These projects are aimed at improving algorithmic problem-solving skills and understanding of efficient data management.

## Linux and Unix System Programming

The Linux and Unix System Programming section delves into low-level system programming on Unix-like operating systems. Explore topics such as file I/O, process management, system calls, socket programming, and shell scripting. Projects in this section involve practical applications and utilities developed in C/C++ or shell scripting.

Feel free to explore each section to delve deeper into low-level programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and system programming on Unix-like systems. Each directory contains projects, code implementations, and README files with detailed explanations, instructions, and resources to enhance your skills in low-level programming and algorithmic problem-solving.
